# Customer Segmentation using DBSCAN

## Overview
This project explores the application of Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm for customer segmentation based on demographic and spending behavior data.

## Data Preparation
- The dataset comprises information on mall customers, including gender, age, annual income, and spending score.
- Categorical data in the 'Gender' column is encoded using LabelEncoder to facilitate clustering.
- Features relevant for clustering, namely 'Gender', 'Age', 'Annual_Income_(k$)', and 'Spending_Score', are selected.
- StandardScaler is employed to standardize the features, ensuring consistency in scale across variables.

## Clustering Analysis
- DBSCAN is initialized and applied to the standardized dataset with predetermined parameters (epsilon=0.5, min_samples=5).
- Each data point is assigned a cluster label based on its density within the feature space.
- Noise points, which do not belong to any cluster, are labeled as -1, indicating potential outliers or sparse regions.

## Visualization
- Dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) reduces the data to two dimensions for visualization purposes.
- The resulting clusters are visualized in a scatter plot, where each point is colored according to its assigned cluster label.
- The visualization aids in understanding the distribution of customers across different segments and the separation between clusters.
- Notably, noise points are highlighted distinctly, providing insights into outlier detection and potential areas for further analysis.

## Significance
- This project demonstrates proficiency in unsupervised learning techniques, specifically DBSCAN clustering, and showcases skills in data preprocessing and visualization.
- Customer segmentation is a crucial task in market analysis and targeted marketing strategies, making this project highly relevant for businesses seeking to understand and engage with their customer base effectively.
- By identifying distinct customer segments based on demographic and spending behavior, businesses can tailor their marketing efforts, optimize product offerings, and enhance customer satisfaction and retention.

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- Unsupervised learning
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Clustering analysis (DBSCAN)
- Dimensionality reduction (PCA)
- Data visualization (scatter plot)

## Potential Extensions
- Further exploration of alternative clustering algorithms, such as K-means or hierarchical clustering, to compare clustering performance and identify optimal segmentation.
- Integration of additional features or external datasets, such as purchase history or online behavior, to enrich customer segmentation and refine marketing strategies.
- Implementation of predictive modeling techniques to forecast customer behavior or evaluate the effectiveness of targeted marketing campaigns.
