# K-means Clustering Script

## Introduction
This script demonstrates the application of the K-means clustering algorithm to a two-dimensional dataset.

## Description
The dataset consists of two features, 'Feature1' and 'Feature2', with ten data points. The script visualizes the original dataset and performs K-means clustering to identify clusters of data points based on their similarity in the feature space.

## Usage
1. Ensure that you have Python installed on your system along with the required libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn).
2. Run the script using a Python interpreter (e.g., `python kmeans.py`).
3. View the resulting scatter plot to observe the clustered data points and cluster centers.

## Results
The script generates a scatter plot of the original dataset and another scatter plot showing the clustered data points colored by their assigned cluster labels. Additionally, the cluster centers are marked with red 'x' markers.
